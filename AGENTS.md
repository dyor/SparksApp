# 🤖 AGENTS.md - DEPRECATED

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This file is now deprecated. All agent instructions, workflows, and guidelines have been migrated to a new skill-based documentation framework.

**Please refer to the central agent skills reference for all instructions:**

*   `CONTEXT/GENERAL/SKILLS.md`

This change streamlines agent guidance, improves maintainability, and enhances the overall clarity of instructions.
